When I was in first grade, my teacher had the class fill out a survey. One of the questions was, of course, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" When I found it again a few years back, I had to smile at my answer. 

> A Computer Operator

It was 1988. Computers were barely a thing people thought about. I didn't have regular access to one, and certainly didn't have one in my home. But even then I knew that I was fascinated with these machine, and my work in life was somehow related to them.

My path since then hasn't been the most traditional. I taught myself a lot when I found things that interested me, and I applied them when I could wherever I went. I'm grateful now to be studying iOS development formally and look forward to a career engineering software that has an impact on people's lives.

I believe that software changes lives, both in the small moments when we take a quick glance at our phones or browse the web, and in long, elegant arcs that span years and decades. My goal is to be present in those moments and to have a positive influence on those arcs; to take the beauty that is code and logic and use it to create smiles, calm, ease, confidence, and health.



Maybe that seems a bit optimistic, but it happens every day. And that's what I want to be a part of.
